# SysCall
This project includes all files necessary to create a simple system call that prints a friendly `Hello SysCall :)`.

The original aim of the project was to create a Docker Image with the rebuilt Linux Kernel, however due to the way Docker Machines work that turned out to be impossible.

* `syscall.c` contains the System Call
* `test.c` contains a test for it
